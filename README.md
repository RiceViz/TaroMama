# Taro Mama
This is the alpha game state for our game Taro Mama

Components:

Grace O'Leary: Created, scaled, and added graphics for game use - ingredient list and table for cooking

Carley Williamson: Created popup demo for the recipe page (also will be used for the help function). This can also be done using containers, which may be done for the MVP or later in development for a better final product. 

Tyran Rice: Added music and interactive sound to the game and also a way to combine ingredients to create the final product (musubi). Also created the pixel art for the musubi
